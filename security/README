This machine generates traffic using tomahawk (tomahawk.sourceforge.net)

Folder ~/pcap contains pcap files

Script "generator" is started automatically at login as daemon by service "traffic-gen"

so you can control this script via: sudo service traffic-gen start|stop|restart|start

for example, to stop it:  sudo service traffic-gen stop
